# Amaretti Recipe - Credits to Angela Rossi who's nice enough to share with me this recipe

## Version 1
* 200g almond meal (I use the one from the Woolworths health section which has the almond hull in it, I prefer this to the unhulled variety)
* 200g caster sugar
* 2 egg whites
* Your preferred chocolate (I usually use Lindt Dark Chocolate Salt)  
 
1. Beat egg whites to stiff peaks, gradually adding the sugar (around 5 minutes). 
2. Fold in the almond meal until it comes together. 
3. You’ll end up with a crumby type consistency.
4. Roll into balls, place on a lined baking tray (they don’t spread too much)
5. Bake for 8-10 minutes at about 160-170 degrees Celsius (whatever your oven standard biscuit baking temperature is). 
 
When biscuits are cool melt the chocolate and dip biscuits into the chocolate and leave to set (if you can possibly wait that long).
 
Enjoy!
